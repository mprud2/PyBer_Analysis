# PyBer_Analysis
Module 5: Matplotlip, SciPy, and NumPy


## Overview
* Create a bubble chart that showcases the average fare versus the total number of rides with bubble size based on the total number of drivers for each city type, including urban, suburban, and rural.
* Determine the mean, median, and mode for the following:
  * The total number of rides for each city type.
  * The average fares for each city type.
  * The total number of drivers for each city type.
* Create box-and-whisker plots that visualize each of the following to determine if there are any outliers:
  * The number of rides for each city type.
  * The fares for each city type.
  * The number of drivers for each city type.
* Create a pie chart that visualizes each of the following data for each city type:
  * The percent of total fares.
  * The percent of total rides.
  * The percent of total drivers.

Finally, we were asked to prepare an Executive Summary DataFrame as well as a visualization showing the weekly fare by city type

## Results

The PyBer analysis found that fares in Urban city types are by-far-and-away the greatest contributer to PyBer's overall revenue, but also the biggest pool of drivers, most overall rides provided, and lowest average fare.  The facts that Urban rides were both the greatest contributor to revenue while simultaneously the lowest average fare may seem counterintuitive, but the average fare is outweighed by the sheer volumes of Urbadn rides (and drivers).  This can be observed in Fig.1, which plots the average fare against the total number of rides, with the size of the bubble being indicative of the number of drivers in each location.

Urban fare is only ~$6 cheaper than a Suburban fare ($25 vs $31) and only
